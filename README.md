# roadmap.sh-clone
### Here, I attempted to clone the famed roadmap advising  website... roadmap.sh

  - âœ¨You can visit the original website by clicking here [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/).

  - ðŸ’»I used the following technologies for the project...

      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/html5/html5-original-wordmark.svg" alt="html5" width="40" height="40"/> </a>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/css3/css3-original-wordmark.svg" alt="css3" width="40" height="40"/> </a> 

  - ðŸš€Next I will add some Javascript for the functionalities in the project.
  
  - ðŸŒ±Later I will be adding user-authentication in the project.

  - ðŸª¡I will also be learning backend technologies through this project.
  
  - ðŸŽˆThe project is solely for learning purpose... and I would like to thank [@kamranahmedse](https://github.com/kamranahmedse) for such an amazing work.
